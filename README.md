**Mystery Island** is a survival and adventure game created in Unity, where players are challenged to explore and survive on a mysterious island. The island’s flora and fauna are dynamically animated using decision trees, meaning their behaviors are influenced by the player’s interactions and environmental conditions, providing a unique experience every time.

## 🚀 Features

- **Exploration and Discovery:** Start your adventure on a secluded beach and explore the vast territory of the island, uncovering resources, caves, ancient ruins, and other hidden mysteries.
    
- **Fauna and Flora Interactions:** The plants and animals react dynamically to the player’s presence and actions, using decision trees to simulate variable behaviors based on factors such as proximity and time of day.
    
- **Survival and Crafting:** Collect natural resources to survive. Craft tools, weapons, and shelters, while managing the island’s resources to prevent over-exploitation.
    
- **Puzzles and Quests:** Solve puzzles and discover artifacts that reveal the island’s mysteries. Think strategically and use logic to overcome challenges based on decision trees.
    
- **Social Interactions:** Meet other survivors or indigenous tribes and navigate complex social interactions managed by decision trees, allowing you to build relationships or avoid conflicts.
    
- **Day/Night Cycles and Weather Changes:** Experience a dynamic day/night cycle and weather changes that affect both the player and the environment’s behavior.
